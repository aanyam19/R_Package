## Model Fit Package:

This is an R package designed to assess model fit.

The function *R_squared* calculates the multiple R<sup>2</sup> value for a simple linear regression model.

A simple linear regression model is defined by one response variable and one predictor variable.

R<sup>2</sup> is a statistical measure that demonstrates how well your response variable is defined by the predictor. In other words, it defines how well your data fits the regression model.

The range of values that R<sup>2</sup> can take on are from 0 to 1, where 0 signifies bad model fit, and 1 signifies perfect model fit. For example, if your R<sup>2</sup> value is 0.50, this means that 50% of the variation in your response variable is explained by the predictor variable.
